# Terse Logback

This is a Java project that shows how to use [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html) effectively for structured logging.  

It also serves as a demonstration of what you can do with Logback and logging in general, including some features that may not be obvious at first glance.

It shows how you configure Logback, and how you can reduce the amount of complexity in your end projects by packaging your logging appenders and configurators in a distinct project.

I've written about the reasoning and internal architecture in a series of blog posts.  The [full list](https://tersesystems.com/category/logging/) is available on [https://tersesystems.com](https://tersesystems.com).
