Project Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project is configured into several modules: `censor`, `ext`,
`classic`, `example`, and `guice-example`. The most relevant ones to
start with are `classic` and `example`.

The `classic` module contains all the logback code and the appenders,
and is intended to be deployed as a small helper library for your other
projects, managed through Maven and an artifact manager, or just by
packaging the JAR. The `example` project depends on `classic`, and
contains the ``end user'' experience where log levels are adjusted and
JSON can be pretty printed or not.

Notably, the `example` project cannot touch the appenders directly, and
has no control over the format of the JSON appender – console and text
patterns can be overridden for developer convenience. By enforcing a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns[separation of
concerns] between *logger configuration* and *logging levels*, it is
easy and simple to manage appenders in one place, e.g. going from file
appenders to TCP appenders, adding filters for sensitive information, or
collapsing repeated log information.

The `guice-example` shows a logback factory that is exposed through a
`Provider` in Guice.

This is not intended to be a drop in replacement or a straight library
dependency. You will want to modify this to your own tastes.
