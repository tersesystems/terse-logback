APIs
^^^^

SLF4J is essentially the assembly language of Java logging at this
point, so if you want to use something else it had better wrap or
interoperate with SLF4J.

There are various wrappers and APIs on top of SLF4J:

* https://github.com/godaddy/godaddy-logger[Godaddy Logger]
* https://github.com/UnquietCode/LogMachine[LogMachine]
* https://github.com/jacek99/structlog4j[structlog4j]
* https://github.com/ffissore/slf4j-fluent[slf4j-fluent]

I have not used these personally. I usually roll my own code when I need
something on top of SLF4J, because the wrappers tend to set their own
encoders on top.

Logback Encoders and Appenders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thereâ€™s a useful blog post on
https://logz.io/blog/lessons-learned-writing-new-logback-appender/[writing
your own appender] for
https://github.com/logzio/logzio-logback-appender[logzio].

There are also additional encoders and console appenders in
https://github.com/takari/concurrent-build-logger[concurrent-build-logger].
