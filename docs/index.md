# Terse Logback

Terse Logback is a collection of [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) extensions that shows how to use [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/index.html) effectively.  

I've written about the reasoning and internal architecture in a series of blog posts.  The [full list](https://tersesystems.com/category/logging/) is available on [https://tersesystems.com](https://tersesystems.com).

## Showcase

If you want to see a running application, there is a [showcase web application](https://github.com/tersesystems/terse-logback-showcase) that run out of the box that demonstrates some of the more advanced features, and shows you can integrate terse-logback with [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io).

### Installation

See the [installation](installation.md) guide.
